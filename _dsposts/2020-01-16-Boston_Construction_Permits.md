## Designing a Therapy Course for Online Students

I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to advise on learning design and modality selection for an online cognitive behavioral therapy course a few years ago. The challenge facing me and the instructor with whom I was consulting was how to adapt the course content to an online environment where students would only meet for an hour and a half per week. The rest of the course needed to be taken asynchronously. How should we outline the content to maximize student learning?

The answer came from thinking through how to structure the learning experience. The first decision we made was to ensure the structure of the course stayed the same from one week to the next. This consistent structure would minimize extraneous load, or unnecessary mental processing that takes energy away from the act of learning. This approach would help the student focus on the material and not a strange new modality with which they would need to learn to interact.

We defined the consistent weekly structure in the following 6 steps:

##### 1. Begin each week with a text page describing the learning goals for the week and the content students could expect to encounter.

The introductory text page provided a mechanism to reduce extraneous load even further by setting clear expectations of what students would encounter in any given week, allowing the student to move through the content at their own pace. By including the learning objectives associated with the week in this section, we were transparent about the way in which we wanted students to learn, inspiring metacognitive reflection to help students become better learners as well as better therapists.

##### 2. Post lectures covering the necessary theory and context for the week.

These lectures provided insight into how an expert in the field thought about the specific aspect of cognitive behavioral therapy covered that week. By using stories and examples, the lecturer also made the material more relevant to students, reinforcing the need to learn the material to accomplish the student's goal of helping clients.

##### 3. Post a written case for students to review, followed by open-ended questions about the case for students to answer in the learning management system. Student answers would be visible only to the instructor.

Asking students to respond to a case provided an opportunity for students to practice the skills taught in the lecture in a professional context. The case questions dealt with risk factors and interventions, the same types of assessments students would need to make with real clients. Furthermore, the written questions provided an effective means of scaffolding learning activities, building students up with a low stakes, ungraded formative assessment leading to the more complex video role play with a partner later in the week.

##### 4. Post a video of actors roleplaying the weekly topic in a cognitive behavioral therapy  session.

For this course, we cast a therapist and a client who recorded a series of videos demonstrating the skills discussed throughout the course. By modeling the therapist-client interaction, these videos provided insight into how students could expect to employ the skills taught in the class professionally, motivating them to learn the content. These videos also helped to scaffold the increasing complexity of tasks by introducing students to the format of a therapy session role play, which they would reenact in the next activity.

##### 5. Ask students to record a role play with a partner for upload to the learning management system. These recordings would be visible only to the instructor.

To record their own role plays, students were paired with a partner at the beginning of the course with whom they would meet every week to record their mock session. Since there were an even number of weeks in the course, students were able to switch roles every week, alternating between the therapist role and the client role. This activity provided a safe environment in which to practice skills necessary for success as a therapist, and by sending the recording to the instructor, students would receive targeted feedback to incorporate into their learning. It also created an opportunity for varied repetition, so students could practice the same skills they reinforced through the case questions in step 3 in a different medium. Finally, practicing with a partner provided an opportunity for social learning, reinforcing the student's intrinsic motivation to learn.

##### 6. In the 90 minute group session conducted over Zoom, the instructor would review the case questions and lead a structured discussion with students about their thoughts on the case and role play.

By completing their asynchronous material before meeting with their peers, students would have much to talk about in the time allotted to the group learning session. By engaging in a structured group conversation facilitated by the instructor, students would reinforce their knowledge by re-engaging with the material for the week and through the social learning fostered by engagement with their peers. After the group session concluded, students could dive into the content for the following week and repeat the process with new material.

##### Assessments

We assessed student success in the course through a separate midterm that asked students to answer questions about cases similar to those in each week. The course concluded with a final project that asked students to research a topic of their choice, as long as it was relevant to cognitive behavioral therapy. This could include a paper comparing outcomes of different therapeutic practices, the success rates for cognitive behavioral therapy among different demographics, or another topic of their choice as long as it was approved by the instructor.
