##### A little bit about James Boyman:

I am a learning design consultant and program manager living in New York City. I started teaching during the 2016-2017 academic year, when I taught Freshman Writing at Boston College. You can find my first syllabus from that course on this website! 

From 2017-2022, I consulted with universities across the United States to create impactful, high-quality graduate degree courses in the online environment. 

The academic departments I have worked with include:

* Fordham University's Graduate School of Education
* Fordham University's Gabelli School of Business
* Fordham University's Graduate School of Social Services
* Yale University's School of Medicine
* Baylor University's School of Education
* Baylor University's Diana R. Garland School of Social Work
* Baylor University's Robbins College of Health and Human Sciences
* The University of Denver's Graduate School of Social Work
* The University of North Carolina's Kenan-Flagler Business School

I plan to use this portfolio to offer my experience and thoughts on learning design for the online environment. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you learn a bit about learning while you are here!
